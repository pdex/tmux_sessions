<h2>Preserving (some) session state with tmux and bash</h2>

<p><b>December 15, 2010</b>. This describes some preliminary work
I'm doing to make reboots less painful by preserving some session
state using tmux and bash. The preserved state is <b>working
directory</b> and <b>command history</b>. Better that nothing.</p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>I work by physical context. Usually between 10 and 30 xterms
running at once, in different virtual spaces across several
monitors. Each of those used to run <tt>gnu&#160;screen</tt>, but
I'm now (December 2010) starting to switch to <a href=
"http://tmux.sourceforge.net/">tmux</a>. Anyhow, the point is that
location matters: each xterm is in its proper place, and that's how
I organize my work and remember what I'm working on.</p>
<p>Reboots are infrequent, but they happen. Reboots cost me hours
of lost work. This article describes some tricks I'm playing with
to preserve the most important part of my context: <b>working
directory</b> and <b>command history</b>. This is a work in
progress.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The key players are <b>tmux</b> and <b>bash</b>. And the key
concept is a <b>per-window history file</b> ("window" in the sense
of tmux windows). What I care about most is my bash history and my
current list of directories (pushd/popd) in a given window. This
article provides a way to preserve that across reboots, and
reestablish enough of a working context to save me a few hours.</p>
<p>Let's say I have two xterms, <tt><b>l</b></tt> and
<tt><b>r</b></tt> (for left and right). Each of those is running a
tmux session, and each of those sessions has four tmux windows:</p>
<pre>
                 l                                    r
    +---------------------------+        +---------------------------+
    |                           |        |                           |
    |                           |        |                           |
    |                           |        |                           |
    |                           |        |                           |
    |                           |        |                           |
    |                           |        |                           |
    |                           |        |                           |
    |                           |        |                           |
    |                           |        |                           |
    |                           |        |                           |
    |  0:root 1:w1  2:n  3:x    |        | 0:root 1:cpan 2:foo 3:y   |
    +---------------------------+        +---------------------------+
</pre>
<p>In my workflow, the window names are pretty constant. So I
address the above as <tt><b>l.root</b></tt>, <tt><b>l.w1</b></tt>,
and so on. Note that <tt><b>l</b>.root</tt> and
<tt><b>r</b>.root</tt> are distinct.</p>
<p>Here comes a 2-hour power outage, or an upgrade to a new kernel.
On reboot, I can get my sessions back via these commands from my
<tt>.xsession</tt>:</p>
<pre>
  <kbd>tmux-session new <var>l.root l.w1   l.n   l.x</var></kbd>
  <kbd>tmux-session new <var>r.root r.cpan r.foo r.y</var></kbd>
</pre>
<p>Those are permanent windows in my setup. If I had been working
on a temporary window at the time of the crash, and the window was
called <tt>devel.bz123456</tt>, I could restore it from any shell
by typing:</p>
<pre>
   $ <kbd>tmux-session new <var>devel.bz123456</var></kbd>
</pre>
<p>When each of those windows comes up, it will:</p>
<ul>
<li>be cd'ed to the same place as when the window closed;</li>
<li>have the same directory stack (pushd); and</li>
<li>have the command history for that exact window.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not perfect: terminal output and scrollback is lost, and so
is environment. But it's good enough for me, for now.</p>
<hr />
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>Your <tt>.bashrc</tt>, asks <tt>tmux</tt> "what's my window
name?" If tmux gives the right kind of answer, bash sets a custom
<tt>$HISTFILE</tt> for this shell. And that's really about it.</p>
<h3>Make It Happen</h3>
<p>Download <a href=".bashrc.tmux"><tt>.bashrc.tmux</tt></a> (login
dotfile) and <a href="tmux-session"><tt>tmux-session</tt></a> (perl
script). Put the dotfile in your home directory and the script in
your $PATH.</p>
<p>Add this to your <tt>.bash_profile</tt> if you have one;
otherwise add it to whatever dotfile runs on login shells:</p>
<pre>
if [ ! -z "$PS1" ]; then
    _tmuxrc="$HOME/.bashrc.tmux"
    if [ -e $_tmuxrc ]; then
        source $_tmuxrc
        _tmux-init-history
    fi
fi
</pre>
<p>Then quit all your tmux sessions and start some new ones using
<tt>tmux-session&#160;new</tt>. (You can do them by hand, or
differently, later. For now just follow what I say):</p>
<pre>
$ <kbd>mkdir --mode=0700 ~/.bash_history.d</kbd>

$ <kbd>tmux-session new aaa.bbb aaa.ccc</kbd>
$ <kbd>tmux attach aaa</kbd>
</pre>
<p>You're now in tmux with two windows. Swap between them, type
some commands. Change directories. Exit. That wraps up your tmux
session. Then <b>repeat</b> the last two commands. Do some
up-arrows, a <tt>pwd</tt>. You're back in the same place, sort
of.</p>

<h3>Further Reading</h3>
<p>Read the source. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Also left as an exercise for the reader:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using PROMPT_COMMAND to flush history after each command (e.g.
to survive crashes).</li>
<li>Finding a way to handle new windows created via ESC-c (which
will be called "bash" by default).</li>
<li>Handling window renames (probably via .logout)</li>
