<h3 class="title">Late Merging</h3>
<div class="item-description"><b>Letter to the Editor of the Los
Alamos Monitor</b>
<p>I'm one of those people who stays in the left-hand lane on
Diamond until the last moment. I don't do it because I'm in a hurry
-- I'm not. I don't do it to be rude; in fact, I do it despite
feeling so. It feels inconsiderate, impolite. It's stressful.</p>
<p>I do it to make the world a better place. Perhaps not for the
few individuals who honk, yell, scream, tailgate, and shake their
fists; but for everyone else a smooth last-minute zipper merge
greatly reduces the overall amount of traffic. Think of the people
turning right on Orange or the wasted left-hand space when the
light turns red.</p>
<p>This is a town that respects science. Look up recent simulations
on late merging; look up <a href="http://www.howwedrive.com/">Tom
Vanderbilt</a>; and look up dissenting opinions (good luck
filtering out the vitriol). Recognize that what feels right isn't
always what is right. And... join me in the left-hand lane. I
cannot promise that you'll feel good about it, nor can I promise
that you'll get used to the feeling. But if enough of us do it we
can take turns, and I'll sit in the right-hand lane and watch you
pass and I will radiate gratitude.</p>
<p>Ed</p>
<p>PS I may never get used to the unpleasant feeling. But when
someone loudly vents their rage, I do confess to experiencing a
frisson of glee. I am not proud of that... but until I become a
better person, thanks, angry people, for assuaging my guilt.</p>

<div class="item-description">Netflix considers me a long-term
storage facility. So on my to-do list for the month, with all my
expected free time, was making time to watch a movie. With less
than 48 hours left of my free month, the moment was last night and
the movie was Volver.
<p>If I were a movie critic I would probably sum it up as:</p>
<pre>
  A tender tale of homicide, incest, deception, infidelity,
  ghosts, and second chances.
</pre>
<p>But I'm not a critic so I won't. Instead I'll point to the
reason I rented the movie, a review at <a href=

<h3 class="title">La Crosse WS-2316 on Linux: Success</h3>
<div class="item-description">For those of you Googling before
buying: yes, it works! I've wanted a weather station for years.
When I saw the <a href=
"http://www.lacrossetechnology.com/2316/index.php">La Crosse
WS-2316</a> in Costco this weekend for $90, I couldn't resist
buying it. The good news is, it works perfectly fine on Linux
(2.6.22). The WS-2316 includes a USB-to-serial dongle which lsusb
reports as:
<pre>
  Bus 004 Device 005: ID 0403:6001 Future Technology Devices International, Ltd 8-bit FIFO
</pre>
<p>The driver for that is ftdi_sio:</p>
<pre>
    Device Drivers --&gt;
      USB Support  ---&gt;
        USB Serial Converter support ---&gt;
          USB FTDI Single Port Serial Driver (EXPERIMENTAL)
</pre>
<p>Here's a udev rule you might want:</p>
<pre>
   SUBSYSTEM=="tty", ATTRS{manufacturer}=="FTDI", SYMLINK="lacrosse", MODE="0666"
</pre>
<p>This creates a <b>/dev/lacrosse</b> symlink to the appropriate
/dev/ttyUSBx. This is especially important if you have multiple
USB-serial adapters. I put that in
<b>/etc/udev/rules.d/99-local.rules</b> . That's for a Gentoo
system; Debian and others may be different.</p>
<p>You can use <a href=
"http://www.lavrsen.dk/twiki/bin/view/Open2300/WebHome">Open2300</a>
to talk to the station. Open2300 is clean, simple, elegant, well
documented, and has a good API for writing your own tools. UPDATE:
Oct 29: If you're a Perl person, try my new <a href=
"http://search.cpan.org/~esm/Device-LaCrosse-WS23xx-0.01/lib/Device/LaCrosse/WS23xx.pm">
Device::LaCrosse::WS23xx</a></p>
<p>UPDATE: Oct 16: The honeymoon is over. I'm a little disappointed
by the unit:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Occasional bad data</b>. Between 1-3 times a day, one of the
data values is garbage. For instance, outside temperature goes to
136 or -20, or pressure goes to 4 or 40. This could be the Open2300
software, or the unit, or even the USB-to-serial adapter. I don't
know, but it's frustrating.</li>
<li><b>No Wind Averaging</b>. Wind speed and direction are
instantaneous values, whatever the sensor happens to be reading at
the moment it is queried. If you log every 5 minutes, you don't get
a sense of what's really going on. If you want to average, you need
to hook up the wired connection (wireless only updates every 2
minutes), log wind speed/direction every 32 seconds, and make your
own averages.</li>
<li><b>Barometer doesn't work well at high altitude</b>. The
minimum pressure it handles is 22.44&#160;inHg, which is about
29.70&#160;inHg relative at our elevation (7200 feet). In other
words, we're right near its limit. In practice, readings around and
below 29.80 seem flaky.</li>
<li><b>Poor display</b>. The LCD display is poorly thought out.
There's no way to see outside temperature and rainfall
simultaneously, you need to push buttons until you get the desired
reading. But time and date, which are pretty useless for those of
us with clocks, are constantly displayed. In practice, I just fire
up my <a href="http://wx.edsantiago.com/">web page</a> instead of
looking at the LCD.</li>
</ul>
<p>You get what you pay for. At $90, this was still a good deal.
More importantly, I can afford it while the $1,000 <a href=
"http://www.landfallnavigation.com/vantagepro2.html">Davis</a>
remains a distant dream. I don't care that much about pressure or
wind speed: what I care about is rain, and to a lesser degree
temperature. So I hope the rain gauge works...</p>

<blockquote>"In normal circumstances, people who turn their backs
on reality are soon set straight by the mockery and criticism of
those around them, which makes them aware they have lost
credibility. In the Third Reich there were no such correctives,
especially for those who belonged to the upper stratum. On the
contrary, every self-deception was multiplied as in a hall of
distorting mirrors, becoming a repeatedly confirmed picture of a
fantastical dream world which no longer bore any relationship to
the grim outside world"

<p>The setting is Northern Italy during the Second World War.
Russell picks up the disrupted lives of Jewish refugees escaping
persecution and of the people who shelter them. Keeping a tight
focus on a small number of individuals illustrates the beauty of
each life, each thread. Russell's quiet matter-of-fact voice
suffuses each tragedy with a significance that no other tone could
match, each character with an almost palpable nobility that makes
the pages feel alive. Through these few lives and deaths we begin
to get a small sense of the unimaginable horror of WWII, of war
itself.</p>
<p>"<a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0449004139">A Thread of
Grace</a>" is often brutal--not gory, but its simple everyday
narration is merciless. This is a book that will haunt me.</p>

<h3 class="title">Trima machines</h3>
<div class="item-description">The new <a href=

Trima machines</a> are a big success. The staff were so
enthusiastic about them, and I can see why! I loved today's
collection.
<p>The machine has a large, friendly screen that can be angled
toward the donor. Entering donor info is simple, as is deciding
what to collect. Based on my previous platelet count, the ABQ
office decided to draw two units of platelets and one RBC (just the
red, not whole). So even though the new machines are much faster --
the first unit of platelets took only 50 minutes -- I still ended
up spending a long time, and wasn't able to make the 10:15 Vinyasa
class at <a href=
"http://www.bodyofsantafe.com/body_studioschedule.html">Body</a>.</p>
<p>The procedure itself was much better than the old Haemonetics.
The cycle is 2 minutes draw, 30 seconds return, compared to 10/5
(or thereabouts) on the old machines. There's also no increased
pressure on the cuff, and no need to stop squeezing. And no need to
count cycles: the Trima's display shows the time left, as well as
quantity of platelets/plasma/RBC collected. (Yes, I can look at the
bags, but I don't have a feel for how full they need to be).
Rocio's only complaint? "I don't have enough to do."</p>
<p>The new machines are on tour this month, on a trial basis for
the mobile units. I hope they work out well: I really liked my
experience today, and three units for the cost (time) of one
certainly seems worthwhile.</p>
